    <h1>Hello, my name is davis and I want to learn coding. I can write books and novels. This is for a school project, and the entire class (exept Ella) did the website with google sites, but we decided to do it with coding. Anyways, I am 11 and my birthday is on september 26, 2011. Also, I did a lot of the 500 lines of code for this project. <h1>
